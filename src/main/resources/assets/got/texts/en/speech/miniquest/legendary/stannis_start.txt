Hi, #. I am Stannis Baratheon, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. My younger brother is challenging my rights, and challenging from scratch. What did Renly do to get the throne? He sat in the Council and joked with Littlefinger, and in tournaments he allowed a more worthy warrior to throw himself off his horse. This is my brother Renly, who wants to be king. Help me regain the Iron Throne - kill the impostor and your name will be sung for hundreds of years.
