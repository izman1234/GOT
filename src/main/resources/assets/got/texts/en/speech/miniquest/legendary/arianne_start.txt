I see you're Dorn's friend, #. At least that's what I've been told. I am the Princess of Sunspear and the heiress of Dorne. Yes, in Dorne, primacy is more important than gender. It's a pity the other six kingdoms don't share this. Myrcella, Robert's second child, after Joffrey, is the next contender for the throne, but the lords of Westeros would rather choose her younger brother Tommen. Joffrey is a maniac and won't sit on the throne for long, but Tommen is already a problem. Will you help me solve it?
