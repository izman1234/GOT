Hi, #. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of her name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals, Roynar and First Men, Khaleesi of the Dothraki Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. I am not an ordinary woman: my dreams come true. Can you help me break this wheel of history, which has long been demanding new ideas that I want to bring to life?
