Hello, traveler. I'm Samwell Tarly, although I'm just Sam now. Frodo, oh, I mean John, told me about the dead man who almost killed the Lord Commander. I've read a lot of books, and I've heard that dragon glass can kill the dead and even white walkers.This may be fiction, but many stories have some truth. Can you bring me a weapon from it? I will not remain in debt.
