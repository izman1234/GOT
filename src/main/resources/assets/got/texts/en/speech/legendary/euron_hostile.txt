Pray to me. Beg me to end your suffering, and I will.
Your place will be where I say it. I am your king.
If I kept every tongue that cursed me, there would be enough tongues for a cloak.
Bow down before me and I will lift you up and make you my priest.
And will you be reborn, #? I think not. I think if I drown you, you will remain a drowned man.
