My name is Mellario of Norvos, Princess of Dorne. Or rather, a former princess, but in any case, I am a princess only in words. My husband, Doran Martell, when our love evaporated decided to send me home. I was glad of it, but he decided to keep my children with him. There is no creature scarier than a mother whose children have been taken away from her. Help me in one thing, #, and I will reward you.
