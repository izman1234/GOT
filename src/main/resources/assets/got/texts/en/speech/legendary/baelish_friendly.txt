What do you want, stranger?
Only by recognizing who we are will we get what we want.
Ignorance often kills.
Knowledge is power.
We are all liars here.
Every good lie must contain a grain of truth.
There is no justice in the world. We will do it ourselves.
A person with a tight wallet is allowed everything.
Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.
This establishment has no equal. Any appetite is satisfied here. Desires that were not in nature until we invented them.
