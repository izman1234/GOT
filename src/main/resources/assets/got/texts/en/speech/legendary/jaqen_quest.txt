Do you want to go on an adventure, #? Our world is full of adventure, it's wide and full of various dangers ... so let the man give you some advice first!
Great! The man has some gifts for you.
You will find this book particularly useful. Open it and look inside!
The scarlet book is a journal of your tasks. Any nation can give you large and small tasks. And, of course, they will reward you for your help!
Now you must learn how to use the map. After all, it really is a big world, and any decent adventurer should know how to use a map.
King Robert is dead. Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne, the king's brothers Stannis and Renly have laid claim to the throne, and the North and Iron Islands are about to declare independence. And across the sea Daenerys Targaryen is gathering an army. It's your choice. Depending on your actions, they will consider you friend or foe.
The reputation scale shows the peoples' attitude towards you. You should familiarize yourself with it.
What's next? Ah, yes. The factions menu can tell you more about all the peoples... their friends, enemies and spheres of influence.
Of course, there's plenty to do in our world. The Lannisters, Targaryens, Baratheons, Starks, Tyrells are all just spokes in a wheel. One at the top, one at the bottom, and the wheel rolls and crushes those on the ground.
Hmm... Oh, the man almost forgot! Take these old daggers with you. I think you'll need them more than I do.
The man hopes he's told you everything, but now I must go. Have a good day, #!
