Into the heat of the king!
I'm good at killing.
A person who does not see anything does not know how to use his eyes.
The gods, if they exist, created sheep for the wolves to eat lamb, and the weak to be pushed around by the strong.
The country is about rocks, trees and rivers. Do stones need protection?
I love dogs more than knights. The dog will give his life for you and will never lie to you. And looks straight into the eyes.
Hatred strengthens a person no worse than anything else.
If you paint a frog with stripes, it will not become a tiger from this.
What do you think they are for, knights? Receive insignia from ladies and show off in golden armor? The knights' business is to kill.
If you cannot defend yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. This world is ruled by strong hands and sharp steel - do not trust whoever tells you otherwise.
