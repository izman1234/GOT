Hi, #. I will be brief. My brother Euron is a dangerous guy who, they say, has recently gone completely insane. In my youth, without thinking, I did not execute him on time, but sent him where his eyes would look so as not to interfere. But I fear that he may one day come back and kill us all in order to take over the Iron Islands. Better to let him perish than thousands.
