I told my son that Greyjoys can't be trusted. It's a pity that I was right. Balon Greyjoy has declared himself King of the Iron Islands and the North, but the North will never submit to an islander. Now the Ironborn have begun to seize our lands, and if Robb's troops head back, the River Lands will be taken to Lannister. Help me put the Greyjoys in their place and I'll reward you handsomely.
