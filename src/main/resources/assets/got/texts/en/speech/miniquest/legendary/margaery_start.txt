Hello, #. I'm Margaery Tyrell, only daughter of Lord Spacetime. The Lannisters have been letting themselves get away with far too much lately. Have you heard any rumors about Cersei's children? Apparently the Lannisters now effectively rule the Seven Kingdoms through the hands of Joffrey, who has no right to be called Baratheon. House Tyrell needs your help: eliminate Cersei so she can't direct Joffrey.
