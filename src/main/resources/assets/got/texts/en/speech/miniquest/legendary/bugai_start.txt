Hello, #. I am BuGai, the emperor of the Golden Empire. For hundreds of years, our empire has been raided by nomadic people - Jogos Nhai. Tugarkhan has recently become their leader - they say that he is immortal and invulnerable in battle. He inspired them, they have already won several victories on the border. I'm asking you to kill him by decapitating their campaign. I fear for my life.
