Hi, #. I am Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Recently my uncle, Benjen, went missing, and with him his entire squadron. I think the White Walkers overtook them. They are led by the Night King. I don't know where to find him, but Craster should know for sure. Ask him. In the meantime, I need a Valyrian steel sword - it only takes Walkers. Will you help me?
