Hmm, I've heard of you, #, you're held in high esteem in the Arryn Valley, bearing the family name of my late husband John Arryn. The Lannisters killed him-I know that. If you are a true warrior of the Valley, then you will prove it by killing one of them, preferably a Demon, once he left my punishment - this time I will not allow it.
