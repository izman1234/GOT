Good deeds do not wash away bad ones. And the bad ones are the good ones.
Kings have no friends, only subjects and enemies.
In a real war, nine times out of ten, the one with the greatest strength wins.

The Iron Throne is mine. Rightfully so. And anyone who denies this is my enemy.
Everyone has a big or little debt.
You call me a royal title, but where is my kingdom? Dragonstone and a few rocks in the Narrow Sea, that's all.

We do not choose our destiny.
Demons of snow, ice and cold. An ancient enemy. The only enemy that matters.
I never asked for this crown. Gold is cold and heavy on my head, but as long as I am king, I have a duty.
