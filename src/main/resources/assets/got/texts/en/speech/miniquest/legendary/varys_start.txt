Hi, #. I am Varys, councilor. I have been working for the good of the state for many years, but I feel that trouble is coming - Robert is dead. But even more worrisome is Daenerys of the Targaryen line. Living Targaryen means claim to the throne. We do not want our country to be burned down by the flames of dragons again?
