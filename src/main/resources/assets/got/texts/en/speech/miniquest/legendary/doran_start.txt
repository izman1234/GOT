Hello, #. I am Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne. They say my brother was born to wander and I to rule. I don't know if that's true, but I haven't been able to wander for years: I have gout and my feet hurt every time I move. But I sometimes walk through the garden with milk of the poppy, which dulls the pain. But it has run out. I would be grateful if you could get it for me.
