Hi, #. I am Renly Baratheon, son of Steffon Baratheon, Lord of the Stormlands. I have always been tormented by the question: why does the eldest son become the heir to the throne, and not the most suitable one? Nobody wants Stannis to get the Iron Throne. I have a huge army on my side. But I do not want to allow bloodshed! Help me kill Stannis and thousands of lives will be saved. We will be grateful to you and you will receive your rightful reward.
