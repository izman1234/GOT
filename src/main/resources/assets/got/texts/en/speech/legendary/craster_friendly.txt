I am a devout person. I have nothing to fear.
Do not believe nonsense. I am not friends with White Walkers.
According to one legend, Walkers are born of ice in the Lands of Eternal Winter; according to others, they are created by the Night King, who lives in the gorge of Frostfangs far in the North.
Say thanks for taking you in, #.
My castle is the only hiding place behind the Wall for people like you.
Why would I leave the Wall? I feel good here too.
It's dangerous here at night.
I have 19 daughters, 19 wives and my own castle. And I do not obey anyone.
There are many interesting things in my house.
I live by the principle: I don't bother anyone and nobody bothers me.
