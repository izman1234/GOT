We were assigned to punish Gregor Clegan, #, and now we protect the inhabitants of the Riverlands.
The Riverlands are safe.
Have you heard of Gregor Clegane? A dangerous man, a bloodthirsty killer.
What brings you to these lands, #?
The Land of the River Land is empty and beautiful, but I do not wish to own them.
Lannisters are our main enemies, #.
Good day, #. Where do you come from?
Sit in a safe camp at night and try to stay in the shade.
We do not walk here, #, but we protect civilians. This war has affected everyone.
We have learned to hide among the foliage of trees and have become invisible to enemies.
There is no one to protect civilians at this terrible time.
Now it is our duty to protect these lands from enemies.
The night is dark and full of terrors.
Don't go on the roads, #. They can be very dangerous during these dark times.
May the Lord of Light protect you!
