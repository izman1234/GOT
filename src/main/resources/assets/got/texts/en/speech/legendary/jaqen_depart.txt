Now it's time for a man to hit the road. Goodbye, #!
Man, I hope to see you again. But for now, goodbye.
Good day to you, #!
Good day! We won't see each other anytime soon, I guess ...
Hmm ... well, #, the person has to go.
Now the person has things to do. May our paths cross again.
Man needs to make a sacrifice to the Many-faced God. Goodbye, #!
The person must move on the road. Goodbye, #!
